This project provides examples based on the job profile description and other recommended topics as follows:

1. Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)
2. Facility Location Problem (FLP)
3. Depth First Search (DFS)
4. Decomposition Method and Branch & Bound
5. Sorting Problems
6. Metaheuristics
7. Dynamic Programming
8. SQL Example

provided in each folder are coded in **C++**, **C#**, and **Python** using **CPLEX** and **GUROBI** as a solver when necessary.

The folders include the following coding files:
* **CPP_CPLEX**: coding examples using CPLEX and C++ (Visual Studio is required (or Visual Studio Code and MinGW G++ compiler), CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **CS_CPLEX**: coding examples using CLPEX and C# (Visual Studio is required, CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **Python_CPLEX**: coding examples using CPLEX and Python (examples are coded using Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook, CPLEX is required if solver is used)


Additionally, a state-of-the-art **Vehicle Routing and Facility Location Research Database** is provided in the Research_Database folder.
