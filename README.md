# Open-Pit Mine Optimization/Metaheuristics Examples

>Please do not hesitate in contacting me if there are any questions or comments

This project provides Open-Pit Mine optimization/metaheuristic examples as well as general examples on how to code optimization/metaheuristic problems in **C++**, **C#**, and **Python** using **CPLEX** and **GUROBI** as a solver when necessary.

The folders include the following coding files:
* **CPP_CPLEX**: coding examples using CPLEX and C++ (Visual Studio is required (or Visual Studio Code and MinGW G++ compiler), CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **CS_CPLEX**: coding examples using CLPEX and C# (Visual Studio is required, CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **Python_CPLEX**: coding examples using CPLEX and Python (examples are coded using Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook, CPLEX is required if solver is used)

* **CPP_GUROBI**: coding examples using CPLEX and C++ (Visual Studio is required (or Visual Studio Code and MinGW G++ compiler), CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **CS_GUROBI**: coding examples using CLPEX and C# (Visual Studio is required, CPLEX is required if solver is used)
* **Python_GUROBI**: coding examples using CPLEX and Python (examples are coded using Anaconda with Jupyter Notebook, CPLEX is required if solver is used)


Additionally, a state-of-the-art **Open-Pit Mine Optimization/Metaheauristic Research Database** is provided in the Research_Database folder.
